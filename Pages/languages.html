                                    to provide low-level access to memory and
                                    language constructs that map efficiently to
                                    machine instructions, all with minimal
                                    runtime support. Despite its low-level
                                    capabilities, the language was designed to
                                    encourage cross-platform programming. A
                                    standards-compliant C program written with
                                    portability in mind can be compiled for a

                                    C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs
                                    since 1979 as an extension of the C
                                    language. He wanted an efficient and

                                    provided high-level features for program

                                    The C# programming language was designed by
                                    Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and
                                    was later approved as an international
                                    standard by Ecma in 2002 and ISO in 2003.
                                    Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET
                                    Framework and Visual Studio, both of which
                                    were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft
                                    had no open-source products. Four years
                                    later, in 2004, a free and open-source
                                    project called Mono began, providing a
                                    cross-platform compiler and runtime
                                    environment for the C# programming language.
                                    A decade later, Microsoft released Visual
                                    Studio Code, Roslyn, and the unified .NET
                                    platform, all of which support C# and are

                                    Java is a high-level, class-based,
                                    object-oriented programming language that is
                                    designed to have as few implementation
                                    dependencies as possible. It is a
                                    general-purpose programming language
                                    intended to let programmers write once, run
                                    anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code
                                    can run on all platforms that support Java
                                    without the need to recompile. Java
                                    applications are typically compiled to
                                    bytecode that can run on any Java virtual
                                    machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C
                                    and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities
                                    than either of them. The Java runtime
                                    provides dynamic capabilities that are
                                    typically not available in traditional
                                    compiled languages.

                                    Java was originally developed by James
                                    Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in
                                    May 1995 as a core component of Sun
                                    Microsystems' Java platform. The original
                                    and reference implementation Java compilers,
                                    virtual machines, and class libraries were
                                    originally released by Sun under proprietary
                                    licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with
                                    the specifications of the Java Community
                                    Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java
                                    technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license.
                                    Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual

                                    implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is
                                    free open-source software and used by most
                                    developers and is the default JVM for almost
                                    all Linux distributions.

                                    Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm,
                                    compiled programming language developed by
                                    Apple Inc. and the open-source community.
                                    First released in 2014, Swift was developed
                                    as a replacement for Apple's earlier
                                    programming language Objective-C. Swift
                                    works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
                                    frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's
                                    design was the ability to interoperate with
                                    the huge body of existing Objective-C code
                                    developed for Apple products over the
                                    previous decades. It is built with the open
                                    source LLVM compiler framework and has been
                                    included in Xcode since version 6.

                                    Apple intended Swift to support many core
                                    concepts associated with Objective-C,
                                    notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late
                                    binding, extensible programming and similar
                                    features, but in a "safer" way, making it
                                    easier to catch software bugs. Swift has
                                    features addressing some common programming
                                    errors like null pointer dereferencing and
                                    provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the
                                    pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept
                                    of protocol extensibility, an extensibility
                                    system that can be applied to types, structs
                                    and classes.
