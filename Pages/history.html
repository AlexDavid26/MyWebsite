                            Coding and computer programming are always changing
                            and evolving. As computer nerds, it’s exciting to
                            think about how we can program computers to do
                            complex things, and to look back into history and
                            see that this has been happening for quite a while.
                            Learn how programmers throughout time have imagined
                            and invented new possibilities with programming and
                            coding, and how they’ve used their (mostly
                            mathematics) skills to make their ideas become a
                            reality.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-paragraph2 position">
                            Programming dates all the way back to 60 A.D., to
                            the time of Mr. Heron of Alexandria. This fellow
                            mathematician and engineer was known for his amazing
                            inventions and machines. By simply re-wiring the
                            machine, you could manipulate the puppets to do
                            different things. That’s one of the first recorded
                            examples where you could program something without
                            having to take it all apart and rebuild it.

                                Ada Lovelace was yet another mathematician, and

                                programmer. She was intrigued by Babbage’s
                                analytical engine so much that after a book
                                appeared about that subject, she translated the
                                book from Italian to English, and learned all
                                about how the machine worked. So not only was
                                she good with languages, she was in theory
                                creating a program, or language, for this
                                machine that didn’t technically exist.

                                used by the Germans and Axis powers, Turin (with
                                the help of his coding team) was able to crack
                                the ever-changing ‘Enigma’ code by inventing a
                                computing machine and reducing the time used for
                                code-breaking. This machine was called The
                                Bombe. By breaking the code, the Allies were
                                able to understand German naval movements.

                                There were actually jobs in the ’50s created to
                                compile expressions, variables, and operators
                                into short code, called “compilers”. The first
                                programming language that can be named that was
                                something called short code created by someone
                                from the company IBM. It was an idea to make
                                coding faster and more efficient (funny that in
                                the 1950s, this is what they thought would be
                                the fastest, most efficient way of coding).
                                “Programming time should be minimized,” was
                                IBM’s statement with speed coding. Then a couple
                                people evolved the language by creating A-0 and
                                Auto code, the first automated computer
                                compilers.

                                Grace Hopper was recognized for creating the A-0
                                in the United States, while Alec Glennie from
                                the UK created Auto code. Because this was
                                around the same time and there wasn’t much
                                collaboration between the two countries (and
                                GitHub didn’t exist) with this type of
                                programming development, they both claimed to
                                have created the first automated computer
                                compiler. The first programming language that is
                                actually still around today was created by IBM
                                by a guy named John Backus. The language is
                                called FORTRAN. The problem back then was that
                                you couldn’t just type this into a computer
                                screen because they didn’t have screens, and you
                                couldn’t type this language into the computer,
                                because they didn’t have typing tools like
                                keyboards, either. So, when FORTRAN was first
                                created, you’d have to encode the language onto
                                a punch card and then feed them into the
                                computer, and see what happens (and you thought
                                C++ took too long). As FORTRAN still exists,
                                pretty much every programming language in the
                                world are somehow based off a language created
                                by Backus. He also created ALGOL which has
                                evolved since then and is also still around
                                today, as are other coding languages that
                                evolved from these, such as PYTHON, C++, and
                                JavaScript.
